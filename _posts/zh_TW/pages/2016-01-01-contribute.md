You are welcome to contribute to the project!
Our main source code repository is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ion/ion/) and there are several aspects you can help on:

  - Improving our documentation (see [README.md][README.md] and [doc folder][doc])
  - [Translations][translation_process.md]
  - Testing code, testing releases
  - Participate on the mailing lists
  - Improving our UIs
  - Coding (fix open issues or implement new features)

Feel free to report [issues][issues] and open [pull requests][pulls], but
please check the [contribution guidelines](/en/faq/contributing-code) to understand our workflow.

**Discussion**

Most Ion Core related discussion happens in the `#ion-core-dev` IRC channel on irc.freenode.net. There is also a mailing list for Ion protocol discussion [ion-dev][ion-dev] and a general Ion discussion [ion-discuss][ion-discuss]. We also have [Slack][slack] (request an [invitation][invite]).
