# Note: if updating this file using copy/paste, you want to make the
#       following global substitution to get the lists of merged PRs to
#       render correctly: s/^- #/- \\#/  (so "- #" becomes "- \#") 
#
#       Also recommended is to check all links to ensure they use
#       absolute urls (https://github.com/cevap/ion/doc/foo)
#       rather than relative urls (/cevap/ion/doc/foo).
