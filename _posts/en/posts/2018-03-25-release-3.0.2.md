### Stop ongoing attack

There were several issues which enabled several methods of attack. With current release deals with the attack properly.

### Long term goals
We reached several goals. We skipped releasing them on old codebase. There are several goals which were reached:

 - Bring it to higher bitcoin source base
 - Improve wallet performance
 - New design
 - Integrated blockexplorer
 - Zerocoin

### Our sources: 
We forked from [PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX) which was a little bit tricky on ion's old chain. Formax deliver here amazing support to get this done in the time frame which was set.

We cleaned with that all novacoin, terracoin and who knows which coin's source which are neither actual nor being continuosly updated. Our main sources are now:

  1. [PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX)
  1. [DASH](https://github.com/dashpay/dash)
  1. [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)

More info will be added.
