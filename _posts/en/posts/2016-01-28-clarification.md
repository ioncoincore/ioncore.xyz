excerpt: Where to find official information about Ion Core and how you can interact with other Ion Core users and developers.
---
Initially, ion.org was used to host the [original Ion paper](https://ion.org/ion.pdf) and became the homepage for the [Ion program](https://ion.org/en/download). The site evolved into a general educational resource for Ion, and is [not affiliated](https://ion.org/en/ion-core/about-site) with the modern Ion Core project. The Ion Core project's official website is ioncore.xyz and while other websites continue to host information about Ion Core, their views do not represent Ion Core. We know that the Ion ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Ion Core mainly uses the `#ion-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/ion/ion), and [the ion-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ion-dev/). We also recently created a community [Slack group](https://ioncore.slack.com) (request an invitation [here](https://slack.ioncore.xyz)) to enable the greater Ion community to connect with Ion Core developers and contributors more easily.

While there are many forums in which the Ion community and, indeed, Ion Core contributors engage, Ion Core is not responsible for those forums or their policies, nor does Ion Core take official positions on the community's decisions to use them. Still, we believe it is critical that the Ion community be able to freely discuss and critique every aspect of Ion.

The Ion community can become extremely excited and heated when discussing Ion, but we must all work to maintain a civil tone. Community members should not engage in brigading, denial-of-service attacks, or otherwise disrupt healthy discussion and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.
