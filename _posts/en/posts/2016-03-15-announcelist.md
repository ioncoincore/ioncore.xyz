In an effort to increase communications, we are launching an opt-in, _announcement-only_ mailing-list for users of 🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛 to receive notifications of security issues and new releases.

While the 🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛 project has a variety of communication channels, this website, Twitter [@ioncorexyz][], [Slack][] there have been a number of requests for an [announcement mailing list](/en/list/announcements/join). It is intended to be extremely low volume, focused on critical notifications as well as to announce new releases.

To subscribe, enter your email address below:

{% include pages/list/announcement.html %}

_Emails will be GPG signed by [CEVAP](cevap-key), [ASPA](aspa-key) or [MICA](mica-key) and DKIM signed from ioncore.xyz._

{% include _references.md %}
