## Logs

- [link to this week logs](http://ionstats.com/irc/ion-dev/logs/2016/02/04#l1454612462.0)  
- [Meeting minutes by meetbot](http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/ion-dev/2016/ion-dev.2016-02-04-19.01.html) 

## Main topics 

- Segwit proposed changes  
- Sequence locks

## Short topics

Ion core 0.12 is at release candidate 3 https://ion.org/bin/ion-core-0.12.0/test/   

The end-of-life policy as discussed in a previous meeting is [published](https://ioncore.xyz/en/lifecycle/).

## Segwit proposed changes

### background

Segregated witness changes the structure of transactions so that the signatures can be separated from the rest of the transactions. 
This allows for bandwidth savings for relay, pruning of old signatures, softforking all future script changes by introducing script versions and solves all unintentional forms of malleability. 
During the last scaling ion conference Pieter Wuille presented a way of doing this via a softfork, and proposed increasing the maximum amount of transactions in a block by discounting signature data towards the total blocksize.  
Segregated witness is part of the [capacity increase roadmap](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ion-dev/2015-December/011865.html) for ion-core.  
More detailed explanations:  
- [By Pieter Wuille at the San Francisco ion developer meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOYNZB5BCHM) (more technical)  
- [By Andreas Antonopoulos in the let's talk ion podcast](https://letstalkion.com/blog/post/lets-talk-ion-277-separating-signatures-with-segregated-witness) (less technical)

Peter Todd proposed two ideas for segregated witness:  
- [unvalidated block extension data](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ion-dev/2016-January/012301.html) which would make future consensus-data-adding softforks easier to deploy.  
- Miners should prove they, or a trusted 3rd party, have a copy of the previous block's data to be able to create a new block, as a way of not further incentivizing validationless mining.

### meeting comments

The discussion about unvalidated block extension data is ongoing.  
Petertodd is working on the prev-block-proof and he'll likely have it ready for review in a few days.  
This idea *can* be used to stop SPV mining entirely, whether we do this or not is an implementation decision.  
It's also possible to enforce that the block must be empty to validationless mine.  
The problem with SPV-mining is that it breaks the SPV-wallet's security model.

### meeting conclusion

As the discussion moves to more long-term ideas of what ion should become, it's redirected off-meeting, as the meeting is for short-term development.

## Sequence locks

### background

[BIP 68](https://github.com/ion/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki)  Consensus-enforced transaction replacement signaled via sequence numbers.  
[BIP 112](https://github.com/ion/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki) CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.  
In short: BIP 68 changes the meaning of the sequence number field to a relative locktime. BIP 112 makes that field accessible to the ion scripting system.  

### meeting comments

The [BIP68 implementation](https://github.com/ion/ion/pull/7184) is done and gathering ACKs, same for the [BIP112 implementation](https://github.com/ion/ion/pull/6564)  
Ajtowns has written some [test scripts](https://github.com/ajtowns/op_csv-test), for which you need to merge both PR's together. iondrak did so at [https://github.com/iondrak/ion/tree/sequenceandcsv](https://github.com/iondrak/ion/tree/sequenceandcsv)  
Downstream consumers have done extensive testing and found the code useful for their cases.  
All the BIP texts are merged and final.  
Petertodd notes he thinks we're still missing transaction-level unit tests for an actual soft-fork.

### meeting conclusion

Review and ACK [#7184](https://github.com/ion/ion/pull/7184) and [#6564](https://github.com/ion/ion/pull/6564)

## Comic relief

    19:29 petertodd        note that I think we're still missing transaction-level unit tests, and I'd NACK an actual soft-fork on that basis   
    19:29 wumpus           petertodd: I think NACKing ahead of ourselves is not constructive   
    19:30 iondrak          wumpus: He's the Clief Naysayer, he must!   
    19:30 iondrak          err Chief even  
    19:30 petertodd        iondrak: I Naysay your speling :P
