## Notes / short topics

- BlueMatt brings some attention to his recent [issue][#10337] that questions the usefulness of the current coin control groupings for manual privacy protection.

## Main topics

- HD wallet auto-restore

## HD wallet auto-restore

### background

Ion Core has a Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HD wallet/[BIP32][]) since version 0.13. A HD wallet is a system that derives all keys from a single starting point called the 'seed'. This allows users to only back-up their wallet once and all future generated keys can be re-generated starting from the seed.

To speed up review and deployment the first version of HD wallet in Ion Core was made simple without many bells and whistles. Now new features are being added to the wallet, like this [HD wallet auto-restore][#10240], which ensures it always checks the keypool when synchronizing with the node and that the amount of unused keys it searches for is large enough.

### meeting comments

Jonasschnelli has worked out a solution that works for encrypted (and pruned) wallets based on the conclusions of [last weeks meeting](/en/meetings/2017/04/27/#hd-wallet-auto-restore), but he's unsure what the gap limit and default keypool size should be. BlueMatt proposes a default keypool of 10k with a gap limit of 1000. Jonasschnelli notices non-encrypted wallets can stay at 100, however that would just make it more complex while key-generation is cheap.

### meeting conclusion

- Bump the gap limit to 1000 and default keypool size to 10000 for all wallets.

## High priority review

BlueMatt asks for [#8694][] (Basic multiwallet support) to be removed from the [high-priority list](https://github.com/ion/ion/projects/8) since it needs some fixes and a rebase. Multiwallet should still be a priority for 0.15 though. One of the fixes is refactoring everything that uses `mapMultiArgs`, which is done in PR [#9494][] which should be added to the list.

Sdaftuar wants to add [#9208][] (Improve DisconnectTip performance)

Jtimon's [#8855][] (Use a proper factory for creating chainparams) is still on the list, while easy to review.

Gmaxwell likes to see the [per-txout + atomic][#10195] merged soon, so there's more testing time on the code. Sipa will do some benchmarks and report the numbers on the PR.
