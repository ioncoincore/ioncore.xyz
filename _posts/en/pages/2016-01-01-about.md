🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛 is an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project which maintains and releases Ion client software called "🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛".

It is a direct descendant of the original bitcoin, peercoin, novacoin, transfer and ion core client released by Ion Core Team after they published the famous [ion whitepaper](/ion.pdf), based on other coins whitepapers (links comming soon).

🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛 consists of both "full-node" software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a ion wallet. The project also currently maintains related software such as the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/ion/secp256k1) and others located at [GitHub](https://github.com/ion).

Anyone can [contribute to 🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛](/en/contribute/).
