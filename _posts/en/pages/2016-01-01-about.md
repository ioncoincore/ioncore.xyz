Ion Core is an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project which maintains and releases Ion client software called "Ion Core".

It is a direct descendant of the original Ion software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous [Ion whitepaper](/ion.pdf).

Ion Core consists of both "full-node" software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a ion wallet. The project also currently maintains related software such as the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/ion/secp256k1) and others located at [GitHub](https://github.com/ion).

Anyone can [contribute to Ion Core](/en/contribute/).
